# TomatoWeb 🍅

TomatoWeb is my personal developer hub — a place where experiments, tools, games, and serious web projects live together without getting in each other’s way.

Instead of being a single app, TomatoWeb acts as a **central index** for multiple independent projects, each running on its own subdomain with its own codebase and deployment.

## What is TomatoWeb?

TomatoWeb is where I build and ship:
- JavaScript and React experiments  
- Developer tools  
- Indie-style web projects and games  
- Production-style systems built for learning, not demos  

This repo powers the main hub that connects everything.

---

## How it’s structured

- Each project lives on its **own subdomain**
- Each project has its **own repository**
- Deployments are isolated so experimentation stays safe
- The hub stays clean while projects evolve independently

This setup lets me experiment freely without breaking everything else.

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS (CDN-based)

## Why TomatoWeb exists

This isn’t a portfolio replacement.  
My portfolio lives elsewhere.

TomatoWeb exists as a **long-term playground and lab** — a place to think deeply, build properly, and ship real things without pressure.
